**The Black Window**. 
Just a mobile, resizable, always on top, clean, minimalist black window.

_Motivation:_ Sometimes I don't want to see part of a PDF, or cover useless or flashy parts of the screen, to optimize attention and speed of studies and work.

_Future implementations:_
- Add a hidden button to change the color;
- Add maximize and minimize buttons (I'm lazy);
- Turn it into an .exe file (I'm lazy).

**The Dark Reader**

Same as The Black Window, but... there's a rectangular hole. It's resizable, movable, and you can even interact with what's behind it through the hole. And there's a full-screen mode. Simple to use and helpful for a focused reading season.

_Motivation:_ When you want to read a PDF, there are a lot of things around, and depending on the font, even the many lines can get in the way. Imagine if all you could see was the line you're reading.

_P.s.: The actual main file is a python file, so you will need it and the tkinter package installed on your PC._
