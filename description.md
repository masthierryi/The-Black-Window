The Black Window. Just a movable, resizable, always on top, clean, elegant and black window.

Motivation: Sometimes I don't want to see part of a PDF, or cover useless or flashy parts of the screen, to optimize attention and speed of studies and work.

Please note: The actual main file is a python file, so you will need it and the tkinter package installed on your PC.

Future implementations:
  - Add a hidden button to change the color;
  - Turn it into an .exe file (Idk how to do it yet).

If you have any suggestions or comment, please leave them on the discussion page.
